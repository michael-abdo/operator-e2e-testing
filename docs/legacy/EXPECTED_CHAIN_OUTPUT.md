## 🔴 Expected Output: Error Cases

### 1. **Operator Timeout**
```
🎬 EXECUTING ACTION: sendTasksToOperator
📤 Sending failed tasks to Operator...
⏳ Waiting for Operator response... 600s / 600s
❌ Action execution failed: Operator response timeout
💥 E2E execution failed: Action execution failed
```

### 2. **Claude Never Says TASK_FINISHED**
```
📊 POLL #240 (1200.0s) - Looking for: "TASK_FINISHED"
⏰ TIMEOUT REACHED
⏰ Monitor timeout reached
```

### 3. **No Failed Tasks (Immediate Success)**
```

## Key Differences from Previous Architecture

| Aspect | Previous Output | Chain-Driven Output |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Loop Control** | "🔄 Iteration 1/5" at top level | "📍 Current Iteration: 1/5" within chain |
| **Action Trigger** | Manual send after detection | "🎬 EXECUTING ACTION" automatic |
| **Flow** | Linear steps 1-7 | Event-driven chain progression |
| **Termination** | External loop check | "🏁 LOOP TERMINATION CONDITIONS MET" |

## Chain Execution Flow

The chain-driven architecture shows clear transitions between states:

1. **Keyword Detection** → `🎉 VALID COMPLETION KEYWORD DETECTED!`
2. **Chain Execution** → `🔗 Executing Chain: [chain_name]`
3. **Action Execution** → `🎬 EXECUTING ACTION: [action_type]`
4. **Next Chain Setup** → `➡️ Next chain: [chain_name], waiting for: "[keyword]"`
5. **Loop Termination** → `🏁 LOOP TERMINATION CONDITIONS MET`

## Timing Expectations

- **Operator Phase**: 3-4 minutes (per previous tests)
- **Claude Phase**: 8+ minutes (with WindowKeywordMonitor filtering)
- **Total per iteration**: ~12-15 minutes
- **Full test (2-3 iterations)**: 25-45 minutes

## Visual Flow Indicators

The chain-driven output uses specific emojis to indicate state:

- 🚀 **Start** - System initialization
- 📊 **Polling** - Monitoring for keywords
- 🎉 **Detection** - Keyword found
- 🔗 **Chain** - Executing chain logic
- 🎬 **Action** - Performing action
- ➡️ **Transition** - Moving to next chain
- 🔄 **Iteration** - Loop progress
- 🏁 **Termination** - Loop complete
- ✅ **Success** - Action successful
- ❌ **Error** - Action failed
- ⏰ **Timeout** - Time limit reached

## Benefits of Chain-Driven Output

1. **Clear State Transitions** - Easy to see what stage the test is in
2. **Action Visibility** - Explicit when actions are executed
3. **Loop Progress** - Iteration tracking within chain context
4. **Event-Driven Flow** - Shows keyword → action → keyword pattern
5. **Self-Contained** - All loop logic visible in output

The chain-driven output provides better visibility into the event-driven nature of the system, making it easier to debug and understand the workflow progression.
