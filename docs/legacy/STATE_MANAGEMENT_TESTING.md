# State Management Testing Strategy
## Op-Loop Duplicate Prevention Validation

### **Overview**
This document defines comprehensive testing scenarios and validation criteria for the shared lock solution that prevents duplicate message sending in the op-loop timing system.

### **Problem Statement**
**Current Issues:**
- Duplicate message sending: Operator analysis sent twice to Claude in same cycle
- No operator completion detection: Manual intervention required
- Content change disruption: Monitoring resets interrupt workflow state
- Missing state machine: No proper tracking of workflow phases

**Target Solution:**
Implement a shared lock mechanism to prevent duplicate message sending across the 4-layer architecture without major architectural changes.

---

## **Test Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Duplicate Prevention - Basic**
**Objective:** Verify shared lock prevents duplicate messages from same layer

**Setup:**
- Single layer (e2e-executor) attempts to send message to Claude
- Simulate rapid successive send attempts

**Test Steps:**
1. Initialize shared lock system
2. First layer attempts to send message
3. Same layer immediately attempts second send
4. Verify second send is blocked

**Expected Behavior:**
```
🔒 SEND LOCK ACQUIRED: e2e-executor
✅ Message sent successfully  
⚠️ DUPLICATE BLOCKED: e2e-executor - e2e-executor already sending
🔓 SEND LOCK RELEASED: e2e-executor
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ First send succeeds
- ✅ Second send blocked with clear log message
- ✅ Lock properly released after first send completes

---

### **Scenario 2: Cross-Layer Duplicate Prevention**
**Objective:** Verify shared lock prevents duplicates across different layers

**Setup:**
- Multiple layers attempt to send messages simultaneously
- WindowKeywordMonitor + ChainLoopMonitor + OperatorE2EExecutor

**Test Steps:**
1. Layer 1 (window-monitor) starts sending message
2. Layer 2 (chain-loop-monitor) attempts to send while Layer 1 is active
3. Layer 3 (e2e-executor) attempts to send while Layer 1 is active
4. Layer 1 completes send and releases lock
5. Layer 2 attempts send again

**Expected Behavior:**
```
🔒 SEND LOCK ACQUIRED: window-monitor
⚠️ DUPLICATE BLOCKED: chain-loop-monitor - window-monitor already sending
⚠️ DUPLICATE BLOCKED: e2e-executor - window-monitor already sending
✅ Message sent successfully
🔓 SEND LOCK RELEASED: window-monitor
🔒 SEND LOCK ACQUIRED: chain-loop-monitor
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Only first layer acquires lock
- ✅ All subsequent layers blocked until lock released
- ✅ Clear identification of which layer is blocking others
- ✅ Proper lock acquisition after release

---

### **Scenario 3: Error Handling and Recovery**
**Objective:** Verify system recovers from send failures

**Setup:**
- Layer acquires lock but send operation fails
- Simulate network errors, timeouts, Claude unavailable

**Test Steps:**
1. Layer acquires send lock
2. Send operation throws error/exception
3. Verify lock is released despite error
4. Another layer attempts to send
5. Verify second layer can acquire lock and send

**Expected Behavior:**
```
🔒 SEND LOCK ACQUIRED: e2e-executor
❌ Send failed: Network timeout
🔓 SEND LOCK RELEASED: e2e-executor (error cleanup)
🔒 SEND LOCK ACQUIRED: window-monitor
✅ Message sent successfully
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Lock released even when send fails
- ✅ Error logged clearly
- ✅ System continues functioning
- ✅ No deadlocks or stuck states

---

### **Scenario 4: Timeout and Force Release**
**Objective:** Verify automatic recovery from stuck locks

**Setup:**
- Layer acquires lock but process crashes/hangs
- System should auto-release after timeout period

**Test Steps:**
1. Layer acquires lock
2. Simulate process crash (don't release lock)
3. Wait for timeout period (5 minutes)
4. Another layer attempts to send
5. Verify automatic lock release and acquisition

**Expected Behavior:**
```
🔒 SEND LOCK ACQUIRED: e2e-executor
[5 minutes pass without release]
⚠️ FORCE RELEASING STALE LOCK: e2e-executor
🔒 SEND LOCK ACQUIRED: window-monitor
✅ Message sent successfully
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Stale lock automatically released after timeout
- ✅ Clear logging of forced release
- ✅ System continues functioning normally
- ✅ No permanent deadlocks

---

### **Scenario 5: Op-Loop Integration Test**
**Objective:** Verify solution works in real op-loop environment

**Setup:**
- Complete op-loop cycle with shared lock implemented
- Use actual QA/UX test data
- Monitor for duplicate TASK_FINISHED detections

**Test Steps:**
1. Start op-loop with failed tasks
2. Operator analyzes tasks
3. System sends analysis to Claude (should acquire lock)
4. Monitor for duplicate sends
5. Claude processes and says TASK_FINISHED
6. Verify single message sent, no duplicates

**Expected Behavior:**
```
🔒 SEND LOCK ACQUIRED: e2e-executor
⏺ Operator analysis sent to Claude
⏺ Claude processes fixes...
⏺ TASK_FINISHED
🔓 SEND LOCK RELEASED: e2e-executor
[No duplicate "Please fix these bugs" messages]
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Only one message sent to Claude per cycle
- ✅ No duplicate operator analysis in Claude conversation
- ✅ Normal op-loop timing and flow maintained
- ✅ Clear logging of lock acquisition/release

---

### **Scenario 6: Performance and Timing Impact**
**Objective:** Verify shared lock doesn't introduce timing issues

**Setup:**
- Measure timing before and after lock implementation
- Multiple rapid send attempts
- Long-running operations

**Test Steps:**
1. Baseline: Measure current send timing (without lock)
2. Implement shared lock
3. Measure send timing with lock
4. Compare timing differences
5. Test with multiple concurrent operations

**Expected Behavior:**
- Lock acquisition: < 1ms overhead
- Normal operation timing unchanged
- No significant performance degradation

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Lock overhead < 5ms per operation
- ✅ No timing regressions in normal operation
- ✅ Memory usage remains stable
- ✅ CPU impact negligible

#### **✅ Duplicate Prevention (Critical)**

## **Rollback Plan**

If testing reveals issues:

### **Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)**
1. Comment out shared-state.js imports in all layers
2. Remove lock wrapper code from send functions
3. Restore original send behavior
4. System returns to previous state

### **Partial Rollback (10 minutes)**
1. Disable lock for problematic layers only
2. Keep lock for layers that work correctly
3. Gradual re-enablement as issues are fixed

### **Configuration Rollback (1 minute)**
```javascript
// Add feature flag for instant disable
const LOCK_ENABLED = process.env.ENABLE_SHARED_LOCK !== 'false';
export const sharedLock = LOCK_ENABLED ? new SharedLock() : new NoOpLock();
```

2. **✅ 100% duplicate prevention** across all test scenarios  
3. **✅ No system regressions** in timing or functionality
4. **✅ Clear observability** through logging and metrics
